# (Reverse) Ishihara Color Blindness Tests

A generator for reverse color blindness tests, i.e., where a shape should be visible only to colorblind people.

**Work in progress.**

When I get around to it, the colors might still need to be fine-tuned and should perhaps be made configurable for people with different variants of color blindness.
Perhaps with some additional tweaking it could also be used for creating "normal" color blindness tests. It would have to be tested together with different color blind and non color blind people.

The technique for generating (reverse) color blind tests is inspired by this public repository: https://github.com/nikooo777/ColorBlind
